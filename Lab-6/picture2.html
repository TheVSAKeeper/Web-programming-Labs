      />This is an African elephant with 22 movable joints. The joint design of
      this elephant is different from the common chain-like design. These joints
      can be adjusted and fixed at different angles, allowing the elephant's
      trunk to be lifted and posed in various preferred positions. The tightness
      of the joints depends on the hardness of the materials used for printing.
      Using harder materials will result in tighter joints. The reason it is
      named "Blank" is to encourage the printer to add color to the elephant's
      body. For those with multi-color 3D printers, they can try printing each
      segment in different colors. When printing, please start by printing the
      tail. If the tail can rotate properly, then use the same printing settings
      to print the other parts. If the tail gets stuck and cannot rotate, please
      reduce the material flow to continue printing.

      any supports and prints well on a cheap FDM 3d printer like the Ender 3.
      Let me know how it printed for you in the comments and makes! This and
      other uploads are possible thanks to my wonderful Patrons. If you enjoy
      it, buy me a drink once in a while and support more supportless models on
